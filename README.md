# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python:
--------------------------------------------

This repository consists of various programs I have written for my class at St. Joseph's College of Art and Science.

This just doesn't cosist of the typical algorithms that are found in any datastructures and algorithms textbook, it also consists of a few practice programs. These are written mostly using procedural programming and the key is understanding and readability keeping beginners in mind.

I this repository helps you in learning star this repository and maybe drop a comment.
