# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python:

This repository consists of various programs I have written for my students at St. Joseph's College of Art and Science.

This repository just doesn't cosist of the typical algorithms that are found in any datastructures and algorithms textbook, it also consists of a few practice programs. These are written mostly using procedural programming for easy understanding of these core concepts.

If you know someone wants to learn these concepts, please share this repository with them. I hope this helps.
